# FinalProject
Name: Joshua Marzic
School: Jackson College (Jackson, MI) 

This was a final project made for CPS 180 (Into to Java Programming). 

The basic requirement was use stuff we learned from the semester. I chose to try to make metors fall(animated) with math problems on them, that are 'blown up' when you enter the right answer.
